Launchpad Trade is built with security as a core principle. Your private keys are never stored, making our platform secure by design.

---

## Security by Design

<Check>
**Your private keys are never stored.** They're transmitted, used to sign transactions, and immediately discarded.
</Check>

This architecture means:

- **No database of wallets to hack** — we don't have your keys
- **A stolen API key is useless** — attackers can't do anything without your private keys
- **No single point of failure** — your assets remain under your control

<Note>
Even if someone gains access to your Launchpad Trade account or API key, they cannot access your funds without your private keys.
</Note>

## How Your Data is Protected

| Data | Storage | Protection |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Private keys** | Never stored | Transmitted via TLS, used once, discarded |
| **Email** | Encrypted database | KMS/HMS encryption |
| **API key** | Encrypted database | KMS/HMS encryption |
| **Transaction logs** | Not stored | No transaction history retained |

### Encryption Standards

Your account data (email, API key) is stored in an encrypted database protected by:

- **KMS** (Key Management Service) — secure key storage and rotation
- **HMS** (Hardware Security Module) — hardware-level encryption

## Transaction Flow

When you make a trade through the API, here's what happens:

```
You send request with private key
         ↓
    [TLS Encrypted]
         ↓
Launchpad Trade receives request
         ↓
Transaction is signed
         ↓
Transaction is broadcast to Solana
         ↓
Private key is immediately discarded
         ↓
Response returned to you
```

<Warning>
Your private key exists in our system only for the milliseconds needed to sign the transaction. It is never written to disk or logged.
</Warning>

## Infrastructure

Your requests are protected by enterprise-grade security:

- **DDoS protection** — automatic mitigation of attacks
- **TLS encryption** — all traffic encrypted in transit
- **Private network database** — isolated from public internet
- **Global edge network** — low-latency, distributed infrastructure

## Your Responsibilities

While we handle infrastructure security, you're responsible for:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Secure your private keys" icon="key">
    Your private keys are the master access to your wallets. Keep them:
    - In secure, encrypted storage
    - Never in client-side code or public repositories
    - Backed up in a safe location
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Protect your API key" icon="lock">
    Your API key authenticates your requests. Store it in environment variables and never expose it publicly.
    
    See [Authentication](/getting-started/authentication) for details.

  <Accordion title="Use secure servers" icon="server">
    Run your trading scripts on secure, trusted servers. Follow our [Best Practices](/getting-started/best-practices) for optimal setup.
