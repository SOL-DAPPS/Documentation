## How It Works

You don't need to specify the platform in your API requests. Launchpad Trade automatically detects the token type and applies the correct settings.

- **Token creation**: Uses PumpFun
- **Trading**: Detects the token's platform automatically
- **Bundle**: Applies the correct wallet limits based on the detected platform

<Tip>
Just provide the token address. The API handles the rest.
</Tip>
