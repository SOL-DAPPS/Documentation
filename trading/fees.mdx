Control how fast your transactions are processed on the Solana network.

## Priority Fee

Priority fee determines how quickly your transaction gets processed by validators. Higher fees mean faster execution.

| Mode | Cost | Best for |
|------|------|----------|
| **FAST** | 0.0002 SOL | Most use cases. Already faster than other platforms |
| **ULTRA** | 0.002 SOL | Sniping, arbitrage, or congested network |

<Check>
**FAST is the default.** Already faster than most trading platforms.
</Check>

---

## When to Use ULTRA

ULTRA mode is recommended when:

- **Sniping tokens**: You need to be among the first buyers
- **Arbitrage**: Speed is critical for profit
- **Network congestion**: Solana is overloaded and transactions are slow

<Tip>
Only switch to ULTRA when milliseconds matter.
</Tip>

## Configuration

<ParamField body="priorityFee.mode" type="string" default="FAST">
  Transaction priority level. Options:
  
  - `FAST`: 0.0002 SOL per transaction (default)
  - `ULTRA`: 0.002 SOL per transaction
</ParamField>

### Example

```json
{
  "privateKeys": ["WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY"],
  "tokenAddress": "TOKEN_ADDRESS",
  "amount": {
    "type": "SOL",
    "value": 0.5
  },
  "priorityFee": {
    "mode": "FAST"  // or "ULTRA"
  },
  "slippage": 10
}
```

---

## Slippage

{/* TODO: Confirm if slippage parameter exists */}

Slippage controls how much price movement you accept during a swap. A higher slippage tolerance means your transaction is more likely to succeed, but you may receive fewer tokens.

<ParamField body="slippage" type="number" default="10">
  Maximum acceptable slippage percentage. Range: 1-100.
</ParamField>

### Example

```json
{
  "slippage": 15  // Accept up to 15% price movement
}
```

<Warning>
Setting slippage too low may cause transactions to fail. Setting it too high may result in fewer tokens received.
</Warning>
