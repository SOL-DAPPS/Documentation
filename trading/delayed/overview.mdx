Same as Instant, but with a configurable delay between each wallet's transaction. Ideal for making multi-wallet trades appear more natural.

## What is Delayed?

Delayed works exactly like [Instant](/trading/instant/overview): you can buy or sell with one or multiple wallets in a single request. The difference is that transactions are spaced out by a delay you define.

<Check>
**More natural trading pattern.** Transactions don't all hit the same block.
</Check>

## Delay Modes

You can configure the delay in two ways:

| Mode | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Fixed** | Exact interval between each transaction | 100ms between each |
| **Range** | Random interval within a min/max range | Random between 200-300ms |

<Tip>
Use **Range** mode for more organic-looking trades. The randomness makes patterns harder to detect.
</Tip>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="You send a request">
    Include multiple wallets and your delay configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="First wallet executes">
    The first transaction is sent immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delay applied">
    The system waits for your configured delay (fixed or random within range).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next wallet executes">
    The next transaction is sent. This repeats until all wallets have traded.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

### Fixed Delay

All transactions are spaced by exactly the same interval.

```json
{
  "delay": {
    "type": "FIXED",
    "value": 100
  }
}
```

<Note>
Value is in **milliseconds**. 100 = 100ms = 0.1 second between each transaction.
</Note>

### Range Delay

Each interval is randomly chosen between min and max values.

```json
{
  "delay": {
    "type": "RANGE",
    "min": 200,
    "max": 300
  }
}
```

<Note>
Each transaction will wait a random time between 200ms and 300ms before the next one.
</Note>

## Delayed vs Instant

| | Instant | Delayed |
|---|---------|---------|
| **Execution** | All wallets target same block | Wallets execute sequentially with delays |
| **Speed** | Maximum speed | Configurable pace |
| **Pattern** | Simultaneous | Spread over time |
| **Use case** | Speed is priority | Natural-looking trades |

## When to Use Delayed

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Organic appearance" icon="leaf">
    When you want multi-wallet trades to look like independent users trading over time rather than a coordinated action.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Controlled distribution" icon="sliders">
    When you want to accumulate or sell gradually rather than all at once.
