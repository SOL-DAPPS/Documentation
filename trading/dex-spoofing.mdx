## What is DEX Spoofing?

When you look at a token's transaction history on platforms like GMGN, Padre, or BullX, you see a list of wallets that bought or sold. Next to each wallet, these platforms often display a logo showing which trading tool was used: Photon, Axiom, BonkBot, etc.

DEX Spoofing makes your Launchpad Trade transactions appear as if they came from one of these popular tools. Your wallet blends in with thousands of other traders, and no one can tell you're using Launchpad Trade.

---

## Where It Works

Your spoofed trades are visible on **Padre**, **BullX**, **GMGN**, and other Solana trading platforms.

<Frame caption="Example on Padre: the Axiom logo appears next to the wallet address">

</Frame>

## Supported Logos

Your trades can appear as if made from:

**Photon** · **Axiom** · **BullX** · **Trojan** · **BonkBot** · **GMGN** · **Padre** · **PepeBoost** · **Maestro** · **Phantom**

<Tip>
Your wallet address is still visible, but it looks like you're using one of these popular trading tools instead of Launchpad Trade.

## Configuration

DEX Spoofing is configured via the `dex_spoofing` parameter in your request.

### Example Request

```json
{
  "privateKeys": ["WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY"],
  "tokenAddress": "TOKEN_ADDRESS",
  "amount": {
    "type": "SOL",
    "value": 0.7
  },
  "slippage": {
    "type": "PERCENT",
    "value": 10
  },
  "priorityFee": {
    "mode": "FAST",
    "customValue": null
  },
  "dex_spoofing": {
    "name": "RANDOM",
    "mode": "NORMAL"
  }
}
```

---

## Parameters

<ParamField body="dex_spoofing.name" type="string" default="RANDOM">
  Which platform logo to display. Options:
  
  - `RANDOM`: Randomly selects from the list below (or none)
  - `PHOTON`, `AXIOM`, `BULLX`, `TROJAN`, `BONKBOT`, `GMGN`, `PADRE`, `PEPEBOOST`, `MAESTRO`, `PHANTOM`: Display a specific logo
  - `FALSE`: Disable DEX Spoofing
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="dex_spoofing.mode" type="string" default="NORMAL">
  Spoofing mode. Options:
  
  - `NORMAL`: Standard spoofing (default)
  - `BYPASS`: Enhanced compatibility with GMGN. Costs **0.001 SOL per transaction**
</ParamField>

<Warning>
`BYPASS` mode works better on GMGN but adds 0.001 SOL to each transaction. Only use it if you specifically need GMGN compatibility.
</Warning>
