## What is Instant?

A single API request that lets you buy or sell tokens with **one or multiple wallets** at the same time.

- **Single wallet**: Standard trade from one wallet
- **Multiple wallets**: All wallets execute in the same request, targeting the same block

<Check>
**Organic transactions.** Each wallet is the sole signer of its transaction. No bundle flags, no bot detection.
</Check>

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Distribute holdings" icon="users">
    Spread your position across multiple wallets for better risk management or to appear as multiple independent holders.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

All your wallets can trade before the price moves.
