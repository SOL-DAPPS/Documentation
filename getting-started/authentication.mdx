All API requests require authentication using your API key.

## API Key

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header of every request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.launchpad.trade/endpoint \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"param": "value"}'
```

<Tip>
Get your API key from the [Dashboard](https://app.launchpad.trade).

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Never expose your API key in client-side code" icon="eye-slash">
    Your API key should only be used in server-side code. Never include it in frontend JavaScript, mobile apps, or any code that runs on the client.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables" icon="lock">
    Store your API key in environment variables, not in your code.
    
    ```bash .env
    LAUNCHPAD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

    ```typescript
    const apiKey = process.env.LAUNCHPAD_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rotate your key if compromised" icon="rotate">
    If you suspect your API key has been exposed, generate a new one immediately from the Dashboard. The old key will be invalidated.
